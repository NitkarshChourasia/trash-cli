# trash-cli
- Use 'trash filename.txt' (Which would move the file/folder with its file structure intact to a secured sudo access folder)
- To restore use 'trash -r filename.txt' (Which would move from secured folder back to where it belonged.)
- For restoring it would need to remember the past move location too. Tackle that too.
- To remove everything inside the file use 'trash -permdel' everything.
- The folder should have a cap limit to store the file, like 20 gb something.
